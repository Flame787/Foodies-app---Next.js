React Server Components (RSC) vs. Client Components (Browser)

- Next.js is fullstack framework with frontend & backend

- by default, all React components in a Next.js project (pages, layouts or other components) are ONLY RENDERED ON THE SERVER!
  => React Server Components (RSC) - they do not execute on browser, but on server

- all the code of Server components is visible via Dev Tools, so it can also be used by web crawlers for best possible SEO

- Client Components - pre-rendered on server, bu then also potencially rendered on client (browser)
                    - they must be rendered on client, because they contain some features that are only available on browser (clientside)

Examples of features that are not available on serverside:
- hooks: like useState, useEffect
- intervals, event-handlers

- if we want to build a Client Component, we have to announce it specially in Next.js

- 'use client' directive - enables to use clientside features in a component
- we put 'use client';  on top of any Client Component code
