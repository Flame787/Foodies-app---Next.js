Installed the stable version of Next-app, not the latest version (NEVER INSTALL LATEST VERSION - INSTABILLITY!):

npx create-next-app@15.1.6 my-project --no-ts --no-tailwind --yes


React Server Components (RSC) vs. Client Components (Browser)

- Next.js is fullstack framework with frontend & backend

- by default, all React components in a Next.js project (pages, layouts or other components) are ONLY RENDERED ON THE SERVER!
  => React Server Components (RSC) - they do not execute on browser, but on server

- all the code of Server components is visible via Dev Tools, so it can also be used by web crawlers for best possible SEO

- Client Components - pre-rendered on server, bu then also potencially rendered on client (browser)
                    - they must be rendered on client, because they contain some features that are only available on browser (clientside)

Examples of features that are not available on serverside:
- hooks: like useState, useEffect
- intervals, event-handlers

- if we want to build a Client Component, we have to announce it specially in Next.js

- 'use client' directive - enables to use clientside features in a component
- we put 'use client';  on top of any Client Component code


Github repo creation:

- start new repository (public), add some name to new repo: Foodies-app---Next.js

-> 'git init' not needed if we already created Next.app with create-next-app command (it automatically uses git & marks changes locally)

.../foodies (master)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/Flame787/Foodies-app---Next.js.git   -> connecting our local code with newly created remote repository

.../foodies (master)
$ git remote -v            -> checking if remote repository was successfully connected, if we can make fetch or push actions to it

origin  https://github.com/Flame787/Foodies-app---Next.js.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Flame787/Foodies-app---Next.js.git (push)

.../foodies (master)
$ git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

            -> *** git branch -M main  -> if your main branch is called 'master', but you want to rename it to 'main' (standard today)

Adding an SQLite database:

npm install better-sqlite3   - package for working with SQLite database

- add code for initializing database in file initdb.js (in root of the project)
- from root of the project, run command: 
  node initdb.js
  -> this creates a new file: meals.db (but canoot be viewed with VSC editor, contains some db-data)

- in meals/page.js we don't need to use useEffect to fetch data from the base, because even frontend already run on server. 
Server components: we dont need to use fetch-requests to fetch data
Instead, we can directly reach to the data on the server.


lib - new folder in root of the project -> meals.js
